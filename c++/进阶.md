# Generic Lambdas

`Generic Lambdas` is introduced in `C++14` ：
```c++
auto glambda = [] (auto a) { return a; }; 
```
With the lambda `Generic Lambda` and `Parameter Pack`, the callback function can be bind like：
```c++
a.set_callback(
    [&](auto&&... arg){return cb(arg...);
});
```

# Mutex

`Mutex` 互斥锁类是一个同步原语，可以用来保护共享数据不被多个线程同时访问。
在 `C++` 中 `Mutex` 是一种「资源」。通常不直接操作 `Mutex` 实例，而是通过 `unique_lock` 或是「RAII」机制的`lock_guard` 以及 `scoped_lock` 进行管理。

## lock_guard & scoped_lock

A `lock_guard` always holds a lock from its construction to its destruction.
The `scoped_lock` introduced in **c++14** allows to lock multiple `mutex` at one time.

## unique_lock

A `unique_lock` can be created without immediately locking, can unlock at any point in its existence, and can transfer ownership of the lock from one instance to another.

A `condition_variable` needs a unique_lock.

# std::call_once

`std::call_once` is introduced in **C++11**, and should used with `std::once_flag`. 
This function executes the Callable object `f` exactly once, even if called concurrently, from several threads.

{% hint style="info" %}
std::call_once can be used to create **singleton** in multi thread. 
{% endhint %}

Also, for singleton, ``static`` keyword can ensure the safety of init singleton object.
```c++
Foo& getInst()
{
    static Foo inst(...);
    return inst;
}
```
**C++11** guarantees that the object initialization will be made only by one thread, other threads will wait till it complete.
